        <h1>TALKING  ABOUT TRADITION MARRIAGE.</h1>

        In the chapter on Tradition, we find that it involves two couples who were<br> 
        Abel and Patricia. It all started when Trevor’s mother used to take her Volkswagen <br>
        to be repaired in Abels garage. We see that Abel was a hardworking man to earn <br>
        a living and also  Patricia was an independent woman and when she met Abel, <br>
        she thought she has got.The man she can leave with and make their feuter look bright.<br>
         But all over sadden, Patricia was not a traditional woman so she didn’t know things <br>
         to do with tradition. When they went to visit Abels mother, the tradition was applied <br>
         there and it was to bow whenever any male gender was passing. And Trevor’s mother was <br>
         doing it extraordinarily. When they got married, there were no celebrations, <br>
         exchanging of rings and they only signed papers to make that they have been married.<br>
          If we link it to the current world, we find that, in most of the tribes,<br>
           tradition is not valued that much, and couples are married in the church where <br>
           they exchange vows, rings, and sign up the certificate that mark they are married.<br>
            And also when we look at which Abel was behaving after drinking alcohol,<br>
             which he used to beat Patricia and do all creasy things and when Patricia went to <br>
             the police to report him, there was no action taken but in the real world now when <br>
             that is noted, action will be taken and it portrays domestic violence.

<h1><u>HUMOUR USED IN BORN A CRIME</u></h1>
<img width="400" height="300" src="./trevoh2.jpg"  style="float:right;">
<p id="about">
    Trevor used humor in the first part <br>
    where he describes the churches and he says that <br>
    the Black church was for the Africans and the reason why they<br>
    took long in the church, "they were sinners so they needed too much <br>
    time with Jesus".(06) Trevor also uses humor in the part where his mother <br>
    took a few days and while coming back he describes his brother "I only vaguely <br>
    remembers my mom being gone for a few days, <br>
    and when she got back there was  now, <br>
    this thing in the house that cried and shat and got fed."(250)<br>
    Trevor used it to describe how his brothers’ work was just to cry,<br>
    to be fed, to shat up and he could not do anything.Humor is portrayed in the<br>
     fourth chapter where Trevoh escapes beatings from his <br>
    grandmother.After he has accidentally perforated his cousin’s eardrums,<br>
    And his grandmother describes him as the naughtiest boy she had ever met<br> 
    In her life. That’s where his grandmother says she doesn’t know how to bit.A white child that will turn <br>
    “blue and green and yellow and red”.She explains how the skin color of Trevoh will be after he has been bitten<br>
    And that’s where the humor originally came in (52).
    Trevor finding humor in the darkest of times, where he didn’t dream of getting <br>
    an indoor toilet and a job as a host. His mother was saying that ,<br>
    she does not care she wants a white man
    And his dad was like well, you know how this Swiss love chocolate. <br>
    due to his color, when they could out for a ride with his parents,<br>
     he could run after his father but when his father saw people in the streets, <br>
     he could run and leave him behind, but when Trevor saw that,<br>
      he thought that the game was continuing so he kept on running after him <br>
      and he could shout loud “dad”
    But that could make his father run faster.
    Humor also comes out as Trevor got older, he turned to stand up mining <br>
    his life experience for laughs. They laughed at everything. Case in point.<br>
    Even the very painful ones. His mother was short and she was shot twice, <br>
    once in the ass and the other on the head. When Trevor was crying and his mother<br>
     was telling him not to cry because of her nose, <br>
     you’re officially the best-looking person in the family.
